# Logan McManus: Project 3

### Repository Structure

This repository contains all the files I used for project 3. There are 3 Jupyter Notebooks, and 3 folders that I have created

* p3DataCleaning
    * This is the Jupyter notebook where I performed EDA. The ultimate result of this notebook is the creation of a helper function that will create a pipeline to use in my modeling notebooks. You will see that function and the accompanying classes copy pasted into the beginning of the other notebooks so they may be used there.
  
* p3Regression
    * This is the notebook in which I create the models used for the regression problem. The predictions for each model is saved in the RegSubs directory.
  
* RegSubs
  * This directory contains the csv files of predicted values generated by each regression model, to be submitted to kaggle.
  
* p3Classification
    * This is the notebook in which I create the models used for the classification problem. The predictions for each model is saved in the ClassSubs directory.
  
* ClassSubs
  * This directory contains the csv files of predicted values generated by each classification model, to be submitted to kaggle.
